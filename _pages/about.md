<!-- 
I was earlier maintaining a technical blog, where need to do lot of work around to put Jupyter notebooks and some code blocks. I really like the way fastpages brought this to this ease of use. Just migrating some of stuff to here.  -->


My areas of interest include Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning. So typically my posts will be revolving around these topics that inspire me. I love sharing ideas, thoughts and contributing to Open Source community. Typically the posts are concocted from my rough worksheets while working on the fundamentals. 
Hope you find something interesting/useful here.

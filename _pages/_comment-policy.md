Thanks for choosing to comment! Here are some basic guidelines:

* Please be polite - a civil discussion can yield fruitful outcomes for both parties.
* Don't troll - comments that involve personal attacks or otherwise rude behaviour will be removed.
* NO spam please - nothing to do with making money, visiting your new fancy website or other non-blog-related endorsements.
